# Project Readme: Dating Event EDA

## Overview

This project focuses on conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset derived from a speed dating event. Our goal is to uncover patterns, preferences, and the dynamics of romantic attraction among participants. We aim to explore how individual expectations on attributes and fields of study or professional domains correlate with match outcomes. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the event's structure on participants' likelihood of finding a match.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information from a speed dating experiment, where participants have various attributes such as age, gender, field of study, interests, and their preferences for a potential partner. Key variables include:

Gender: Participant's gender.
Age: Participant's age.
Field of Study: Participant's field of study or professional domain.
Interests: Participant's interests.
Preferences: Attributes that participants value in a potential partner.
Match: Indicates whether a pair of participants decided to exchange contact information.

## Objectives

Attribute Expectations: Analyze participants' expectations on attributes and how these expectations affect match rates.
Field Correlation: Examine the correlation between participants' fields of study or professional domains and matching patterns.
Event Dynamics: Investigate how the progression of the event influences match outcomes.
General Trends: Identify general trends and insights regarding the dynamics of romantic attraction and compatibility.

## Implications

Understanding the correlation between various factors and match outcomes
